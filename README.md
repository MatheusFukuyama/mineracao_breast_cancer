## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

This project helps me to remind how to use the :hover effect and I also some flex properties. Talking about new knowledge I learned structure a project, read the project design to produce a code, to write a readme to the project, what is a markdowna and finally how to use landmarks.

### Continued development

I'm still want to improve my logic and also learn to write clean code, this project still can pass through changes and refactoring while I get more knowledges.
